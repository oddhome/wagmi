# Prepare Hooks

In previous versions of wagmi, "transactional" hooks such as `useSendTransaction` and `useContractWrite` performed potentially long-running asynchronous work. These hooks internally invoke the [ethers `signer.sendTransaction` function](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/signer/#Signer-sendTransaction) that fetches the gas estimate & block number, and resolves an ENS name (if needed) before the transaction gets sent. On a slow network, these asynchronous tasks can take a while.

Performing asynchronous tasks in an event handler (like a button) or in an event that wasn't initiated by the user (like a page load) is not ideal as it can lead to a variety of connected user-experience (UX) related pitfalls ([listed below](#ux-pitfalls-without-prepare-hooks)).

Prepare Hooks allow you to eagerly perform this asynchronous work beforehand & generate the parameters required for their paired hook (e.g. `usePrepareSendTransaction` prepares a request for `useSendTransaction`).

wagmi currently has the following Prepare Hooks:

- [`usePrepareContractWrite`](/docs/prepare-hooks/usePrepareContractWrite)
- [`usePrepareSendTransaction`](/docs/prepare-hooks/usePrepareSendTransaction)

## UX Pitfalls without Prepare Hooks

You may have noticed one of the following pitfalls when using "transactional" hooks without performing the asynchronous work beforehand.

### Slow TTOW (Time To Open Wallet)

Performing long-running async work in between a user interaction (i.e. click handler) and opening the wallet can lead to a slow TTOW (Time To Open Wallet).

Under slow network conditions, it may confuse the end-user as to why the wallet is taking a while to open.

The video below shows the difference between a slow TTOW and a fast TTOW.

### iOS App Link Constraints

When using WalletConnect on iOS and triggering a wallet interaction (e.g. when sending a transaction or signing a message), you may experience issues where the native app is not opened as expected and a browser navigation occurs instead (as seen in the above video). For some wallets (e.g. [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/)) this will present a fallback website, while other wallets (e.g. [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)) will redirect to the App Store.

This issue occurs because app links on iOS will only open the native app when the following rules are followed:

- **The wallet interaction must be triggered by a user-initiated event**, e.g. in a click handler rather than on page load or in an asynchronous callback.
- **The wallet interaction must be triggered as soon as possible within the event handler.** Any preceding asynchronous work (e.g. estimating gas, resolving an ENS name, fetching a nonce) should have already completed before the event handler fires.

### No upfront validation

When using "transactional" hooks such as `useContractWrite` & `useSendTransaction`, the user will only get feedback on the status of the transaction once they have invoked the click handler.

There are some cases where we can perform upfront validation on a contract or transaction request before the user interacts with the click handler (such as checking if we can still mint on a contract).

See the comparison below for when a user tries to mint a sold out NFT.

By using a Prepare Hook, we can perform this eager validation before the click handler is invoked.

```tsx {5,17}
import * as React from 'react'
import { usePrepareContractWrite, useContractWrite } from 'wagmi'

export function MintNFT() {
  const { config, error, isError } = usePrepareContractWrite({
    addressOrName: '0xFBA3912Ca04dd458c843e2EE08967fC04f3579c2',
    contractInterface: ['function mint()'],
    functionName: 'mint',
  })
  const { data, write } = useContractWrite(config)

  return (
    <div>
      <button disabled={!write} onClick={() => write()}>
        Mint
      </button>
      {isError && <div>Error: {error.message}</div>}
    </div>
  )
}
```
